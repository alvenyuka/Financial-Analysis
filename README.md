In this project, I created a live Excel workbook with dynamic formulas designed to track and analyze a personal stock portfolio.

Dashboard Sheet
Purpose: Shows a  detailed summary of the key metrics 
Features:
Lists Current Holdings with details such as stock name, industry, units held, current price, market value, and gain/loss.
Includes a Portfolio by Industry section to visualize market value distribution across sectors.
Contains a Watchlist section for tracking stocks of interest.

Ledger Sheet

Purpose: Records all transactions in a detailed and organized manner.

Features:

Trades are logged with Date, Stock, Transaction Type (Buy/Sell), Units, Price, Currency, and Transaction Amount.

Formulas automatically calculate the transaction amount.

Stock-Specific Sheets (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, Fiverr, JP Morgan, Raytheon)

Purpose: Provide detailed information and historical data for individual stocks.

Features:

Include Exchange and Ticker Symbol for reference.

Some sheets (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock) contain additional data or formulas for tracking stock performance over time.

Key Skills Gained from Working with This File:
Advanced Excel Functions
Use of array formulas (_xlfn.ANCHORARRAY) for dynamic calculations.
Application of conditional formatting (implied by the structured layout).
Mathematical operations to compute market value, gains/losses, and transaction totals.
Financial Tracking and Analysis
Ability to track portfolio performance in real-time, including market value and unrealized gains/losses.
Analyze industry distribution to assess diversification and sector-specific performance.
Data Organization
Structured ledger management for recording and categorizing transactions.
Dynamic data linking between sheets (e.g., Dashboard pulling data from Ledger and stock-specific sheets).
Automation and Efficiency
Use of formulas to automate calculations, reducing manual errors (e.g., transaction amounts, market values).
Scalability to add new stocks or transactions without disrupting existing data.
Attention to Detail
Ensuring accuracy in data entry (e.g., dates, units, prices) for reliable portfolio tracking.
Troubleshooting errors (e.g., #VALUE! flags) to maintain data integrity.
Visualization and Reporting
Dashboard design for at-a-glance insights into portfolio health.
Potential use of charts/graphs (implied by the "Portfolio by Industry" section) to visualize data trends.
